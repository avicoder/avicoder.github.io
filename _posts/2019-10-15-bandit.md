#### ► Level 13


The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt,
which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. 
For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir.
For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123.
Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)


Lazy to type all the commands - Please check the screenshot.

#### ► Level 14


The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.


`ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost`

`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`

#### ► Level 15


The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

`nc localhost 30000`

![l15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avicoder/avicoder.github.io/master/images/l15.png)

#### ► Level 16

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

`openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001`

![l16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avicoder/avicoder.github.io/master/images/l16.png)

#### ► Level 17

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

` nmap localhost -p 31000-32000 -A`

`openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790`

` ssh -i ssh.key bandit17@localhost`

![l17-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avicoder/avicoder.github.io/master/images/l17-2.png)

#### ► Level 18

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19

`diff passwords.old passwords.new`


![l18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avicoder/avicoder.github.io/master/images/l18.png)

#### ► Level 19

The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.


` ssh -T  bandit18@localhost`

![l19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avicoder/avicoder.github.io/master/images/l19.png)

#### ► Level 20

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

`./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20`


![l20](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avicoder/avicoder.github.io/master/images/l20.png)

#### ► Level 21

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

`./suconnect 32322`

`nc -lvp 32322`

#### ► Level 22

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

ls /etc/cron.d
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

#### ► Level 23
 
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.
