Fist bump folks,

I don't have much here about to talk about this Fitbit clock-face.

One of my friend wanted to have an elegant clock-face for her Fitbit sense with support of dual clock so I made one on weekends. It is compatible with Sense and Versa 3 and built on  Fitbit SDK 5.0

You can try it on your Fitbit Sense by installing it from [here](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/c422e397-ea03-4f64-84af-e01e4a81b328)

It has these features and more will be added depending on the demand, open a [issue](https://github.com/avicoder/Dual-TZ) for any more enhancements and bugs.

 - Added two GMT timezone on the clock face
 - Great for travellers
 - 4 stats right on the screen
   - Steps
   - BPM
   - KCal
   - Distance

Thanks
