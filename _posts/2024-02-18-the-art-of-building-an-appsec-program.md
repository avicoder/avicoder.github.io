Creating a robust AppSec program is no easy feat. It requires a deep understanding of both the development process and security principles. But what does it take to build an AppSec program that not only secures applications but also wins the hearts of developers???

Let's explore some strategies:

### Understanding the Developer's Mindset

Developers are often under immense pressure to deliver new features, fix bugs, and meet product deadlines.

Security, while important, can sometimes feel like a hindrance to their primary goals.

To engage developers in security practices, it's essential to present the "why" behind security measures. For example, explaining the risks associated with not updating a vulnerable library can be more effective than simply instructing them to update it. Security should not just be about following orders; it should be about understanding and mitigating risks.

### Creating a Partnership with Developers

A successful AppSec program is not a one-way street. It's about creating a partnership where both security and development teams work together towards a common goal.

This means involving developers in security discussions, understanding their challenges, and finding solutions that work for both sides. For example, allocating a portion of the development sprint for security tasks can help integrate security into the development lifecycle without overwhelming developers with additional work.

### Security Champions: The Key to Sustained Engagement

One effective way to maintain a strong security posture within the development team is through a Security Champions program.

By appointing and empowering security-minded individuals within development teams, organisations can ensure that security considerations are woven into the fabric of the development process.

However, the success of such a program depends on keeping it engaging and relevant. This can be achieved by treating these champions as equals in security discussions and giving them the autonomy to bring up concerns and suggestions.

### Advocating for Both Security and Development

An AppSec leader should not only advocate for security within the development teams but also represent the needs and concerns of developers within the security team.

This two-way advocacy ensures that decisions are balanced and take into account the practicalities of implementing security measures. For example, if developers are struggling with a particular security tool, it's the AppSec leader's role to find a solution that makes the developers' jobs easier while still maintaining security standards.

### Building Relationships Across the Organization

Building relationships across different functions within the organization is crucial for an AppSec leader. This involves not only working closely with developers and product managers but also engaging with senior leadership to ensure security is integrated into the business strategy. Effective communication and the ability to translate technical jargon into business risks are essential skills for any AppSec professional.

The future of application security hinges on Collaboration, Empathy, and a deep understanding of both security and development. By listening to developers, advocating for their needs, and integrating security into the development process, AppSec programs can become a seamless part of software development.

> Remember the advice: "We have two ears and one mouth, so we should listen twice as much as we speak."

This philosophy can guide AppSec leaders to create programs that are not only effective but also embraced by those who implement them.

Stay tuned for more insights and discussions on the future of application security. And remember, **the key to a successful AppSec program lies in collaboration, not dictation.**
