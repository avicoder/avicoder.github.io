Following my CISSP certification, I have a few opinions to share.


Newcomers - don't wait, opt for it!

 In fact, it should be one of the first certificates pursued after a couple of years of experience. I regret not doing it earlier.


I think it is not as complicated as it has been advertised to be, but it depends on the individual. I have only read a few books and I believe you will be ready to start.


During the course of reading these books, I have abandoned my idea that these are textbooks that I would need to complete in order to become a certified CISSP. Instead, I am enjoying it as a regular book. This has opened new avenues for me and enabled me to be a better analytical thinker.


This means that, for example, if the module discusses the kind of processes that are done during BCP or asset management, I focus on the exact required entities and the steps that have to be considered rather than sharing ideas from flash cards and all that stuff.


Thanks [CC](https://www.isc2.org/certified-in-cybersecurity), it helped.

There is currently a promotion running for the 1st million candidates who can attempt the Certified in Cybersecurityâ„  - CC examination and receive one year of free training materials from ISC2. The CC certification is a unique entry level certification provided by ISC2, which is one of a kind in the industry. Through this opportunity, I had the opportunity to give an exam at the center and to brush up on my basics. 


I had booked my exam 1 month in advance and spent nights reading these two books only:
